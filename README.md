A portfolio website created for and by <em> Ankush Patil</em>.

- **Performant:** This website is created with performance in mind. It has received multiple tweaks and fixes for performance improvement and optimizations.
- **Minimalist:** The design follows minimalistic standards, such as small box-shadows not too bright/noticable but present to keep the content feeling alive.
- **Informative:** Includes personal social links, current/past projects the author has worked upon, the education and work background and most importantly a [Resume](http://portfolio-948da.web.app/resume).
